# Data-Analysis-in-R
This repository comprises of my data analysis projects in R. Most of the files are in R-script/R-markdown and there's exception for a powerpoint 
presentation that explains the process of my "IMDB movie dataset" and the insight I gained from it through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

You could find the following projects in order:
1. IMDB movie data set - EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
2. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data set - generating moving averages forecast to predict price index trends and comparing models using metrics such
as MAE, MASE, RelMAE to evaluate the performance of forecast models.
